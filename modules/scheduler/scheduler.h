 * This module provides a function scheduler. You can call
 * scheduler_add_event for adding a function to the scheduler, and
 * specifying what interval between each call. During the execution of
 * the function, interrupts are masked !! So use this module with
 * caution (small functions) for avoiding problems.
 *
 * Functions with a high priority value will be call before others
 * (default is 128).
 *
 * @todo Study the implications of having ported it to FPGA regarding interuptions
 * masking.
